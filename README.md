The purpose of this application is to help payroll accountants at a factory to calculate the attendance for workers.
Currently there are many issues which makes the process quite complicated and requires a lot of manual adjustments.
The reason for this is that the current attendance scanner is very basic.
As such anyone can 'check-in' or 'check-out' many times. For example an employee can check in at 9:00 AM then go get something from his car then check in again at 9:03 AM.
Often there are people that are worried that the scanner did not scan correctly so they check-in or check-out many times when the scanner already scanned correctly.
Sometimes people forget to check-in or check-out so the in/outs do not correctly align.
This is where the application helps. It gives tries to align those entries as much as possible.
It also highlights shifts with an abnormal number of hours (possible check-in/out errors) which makes it much easier for the accountants.
